    <h3 class="ml-3">San Souci theatre</h3>
    <p class="ml-3">
      The San Souci theatre at 30 Park Street (now Mother Teresa Sarani),
      Kolkata-700016, was burned to the ground in 1843. The property was
      purchased by Jesuits from Belgium and became the present campus.

    <h3 class="ml-3">Foundation years</h3>
    <p class="ml-3">
      The motto Nihil ultra along with the crest of the college date to the
      rectorship of Jesuit Fr. O"Neill, 1904â€“1913.The present imposing
      five-storied building was built from 1934 to 1940 at a cost of Rs 9 lakhs,
      which was collected partly from the public of Calcutta, assistance from
      Belgium, and the huge rental received from the American army that occupied
      the building during the second World War. Expansion of the school has been
      a long effort, with a campus slated for Salt Lake City, Kolkata and a
      second boys' hostel not far from the existing one. A commemorative stamp
      was issued by the Indian Post Office on 12 April 1985 depicting the campus
      and in its commentary recognising the school's contribution to society.In
      2019,the foundation stone was laid for a new kindergarten section.

    <h2>Step towards university</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Xavier is expanding into tertiary education in collaboration with other
      groups, as with the Jesuit Xavier School of Management in Jamshedpur, on a
      new 17-acre campus in Rajarhat near New Town, Kolkata. A research centre
      with post-graduate courses is also planned. While schools of engineering
      and medicine are being considered, plans are progressing slowly to assure
      that fees will remain low and a wide range of students will be able to
      afford the education
